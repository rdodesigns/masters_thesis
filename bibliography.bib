abstract = {Lanthanide ions possess fascinating optical properties and their discovery, first industrial uses and present high technological applications are largely governed by their interaction with light. Lighting devices (economical luminescent lamps, light emitting diodes), television and computer displays, optical fibres, optical amplifiers, lasers, as well as responsive luminescent stains for biomedical analysis, medical diagnosis, and cell imaging rely heavily on lanthanide ions. This critical review has been tailored for a broad audience of chemists, biochemists and materials scientists; the basics of lanthanide photophysics are highlighted together with the synthetic strategies used to insert these ions into mono- and polymetallic molecular edifices. Recent advances in NIR-emitting materials, including liquid crystals, and in the control of luminescent properties in polymetallic assemblies are also presented. (210 references.).},

abstract = {Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a simple, highly sensitive direct absorption technique based on the rate of absorption of light circulating in an optical cavity. CRDS can be used to study atoms and molecules in the gas and condensed phase, and is especially powerful for measuring strong absorptions of species present in trace amounts or weak absorptions of abundant species. The technique can be applied in physical, atmospheric, environmental and analytical chemistry, also combustion science, physics, medical diagnostics and biology "Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy: Techniques and Applications" provides a practical overview of this valuable analytical tool, explaining the fundamental concepts and experimental methods, and illustrating important applications. The book presents a complete and methodical approach to the topic and describes: Introductory concepts and basic experimental techniquesUseful variants such as continuous wave, phase shift, and broadband CRDSRecent developments in the field, and key applications, for example, spectroscopic studies of transient molecules, monitoring trace amounts of atmospheric species, analysis of exhaled breath in clinical diagnostics, and CRDS under extreme conditions. Designed as both an introductory text and a reference source, this book is relevant for scientists unfamiliar with CRDS who are interested in using the technique in their research, as well as experienced users.},

abstract = {The europium absorption spectrum has been photographed at high resolution in the spectral region 7200-2100 A which includes the entire sharp-line spectrum longward of the first ionization limit. Wavelengths and wavenumbers have been determined bycomparison with thorium standards. Since all transitions take place from the ground level the wavenumbers correspond to excitation energies of even-parity levels with total angular momentum (J) of A, 7 or 9. J-values and gj-values have been determined for many of these levels from a study of the longitudinal Zeeman effect in the 5 T (50 kG) field of a superconducting solenoid magnet. The configurations 4f7 (8S) 6s 6p, 4f7 (8S) 6s 7p, 4f7 (8S) 5d 6p and 4f6 (7F) 5d 6s2 are discussed in detail. Levels of 4f6 (7F) 5d2 6s and 4f7 (6I) 6s 6p are reported for the first time. Several long series and parts of series have been discovered among the highly excited levels. Some of these can be identified with levels arising from 4f7 6s (9S) np and 4f7 6s (7S) np but inter- pretation is complicated by the presence of several perturbations of unknown origin.},

abstract = {The first demonstration of a cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) based technique, applied to HPLC detection is reported. Broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS) has been used for detection in a HPLC system (HPLC-BBCEAS). Measurements were made on the dyes rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B between 450 and 600 nm. The sensitivity of the measurements as determined by the minimum detectable change in the absorption coefficient, αmin, were 2.9 × 10−5 cm−1 at 527 nm and 1.9 × 10−5 cm−1 at 556 nm, the peak absorption wavelengths of rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) for the two dyes were 426 and 271 pM, respectively. The LOD of the HPLC-BBCEAS setup was found to be between 54 and 77 times lower than with a Perkin-Elmer HPLC (series 200) comprising a 200EP photodiode array detector. The sensitivity of the developed setup also compared favorably with the previous single wavelength HPLC-CRDS studies while using a considerably lower cost experimental se...},

abstract = {A novel method for applying cavity ring-down spectroscopy in the liquid phase, compatible with LC analyses, is presented. The core of the setup is a home-built cavity ring-down flow cell (cell volume 12 μL) that is constructed using a silicon rubber spacer, which is clamped leak-tight between two high-reflectivity mirrors. The mirrors are in direct contact with the liquid flow, which provides for a small path length and short ring-down times. Inside the cavity there are no windows, reflection losses, or Brewster angles to be considered. Due to the small size of the presented cavity geometry, the setup can be implemented in conventional-size LC apparatuses. With a flow injection setup, a detection limit of 2.5 nM was obtained for Crystal Violet in ethanol, and the linear dynamic range of the system is at least 2 orders of magnitude. The method has the potential to become a powerful alternative for commercial LC UV/visible absorbance detectors.},

High-finesse fiber cavities were fabricated from FBGs made in both germanium/boron-co-doped photosensitive fiber and hydrogen-loaded Corning SMF-28 fiber. Optical losses in these cavities were determined from the measured Fabry--Perot transmission spectra and cavity ring-down spectroscopy. For a 10-m-long single-mode fiber cavity, ring-down times in excess of 2 ms were observed at 1563.6 nm, and individual laser pulses were resolved. An evanescent-wave access block was produced within a fiber cavity, and an enhanced sensitivity to optical loss was observed as the external medium's refractive index was altered.},

We successfully demonstrate the use of this visible-enhanced source for a three-color imaging of HeLa cells in wide-field microscopy.},

in combination with a Fourier-transform spectrometer to measure the spin-forbidden B-band of
gaseous oxygen at
∼688 nm and several weak absorption transitions of water vapor in the
same spectral region at room temperature in ambient air. The experiments demonstrate that the
sensitivity of a Fourier-transform spectrometer can be significantly improved by increasing the
effective path length, while retaining a rather small sample volume. In comparison with a single-pass
absorption measurement, we report a path-length enhancement factor of 200 and an improvement
of the signal-to-noise ratio of
≈6 in the present cavity-enhanced absorption experiment. The
practical advantages and limitations of this novel approach are outlined and potential
applications are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {A short overview of recent results on the effects of pressure (collisions) regarding the shape of isolated infrared lines of water vapour is presented. The first part of this study considers the basic collisional quantities, which are the pressure-broadening and -shifting coefficients, central parameters of the Lorentzian (and Voigt) profile and thus of any sophisticated line-shape model. Through comparisons of measured values with semi-classical calculations, the influences of the molecular states (both rotational and vibrational) involved and of the temperature are analysed. This shows the relatively unusual behaviour of H(2)O broadening, with evidence of a significant vibrational dependence and the fact that the broadening coefficient (in cm(-1) atm(-1)) of some lines increases with temperature. In the second part of this study, line shapes beyond the Voigt model are considered, thus now taking 'velocity effects' into account. These include both the influence of collisionally induced velocity changes that lead to the so-called Dicke narrowing and the influence of the dependence of collisional parameters on the speed of the radiating molecule. Experimental evidence of deviations from the Voigt shape is presented and analysed. The interest of classical molecular dynamics simulations, to model velocity changes, together with semi-classical calculations of the speed-dependent collisional parameters for line-shape predictions from 'first principles', are discussed.},

abstract = {This book discusses those concepts of group theory that are applied to the spectra of impurity ion in crystals. Beginning with the simple hydrogen atom, spectroscopic notation and angular momentum operators are discussed. This is followed by a general discussion of angular momentum theory including Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the Wigner-Eckart theorem, unit spherical tensors, and Racah coefficients. The extension of these techniques to the electronic configuration, nlN, for N equivalent electrons is discussed. The theory of point groups as applied to ions in solids is introduced, along with the use of the International Tables of Crystallography and character tables. The phenomenological theory of crystal fields is discussed in some detail along with the so-called free-ion parameters characterizing the Coulomb interaction, the spin-orbit interaction, and the interconfiguration interaction. The use of tables of 3-j and 6-j symbols used in the calculation of the matrix elements of the various interactions is presented, along with other tables and aids in the computation of the energy levels. The point ion model of crystal-field interaction is discussed with particular emphasis on recent work done on its development. The earlier work was applied to triply ionized rare-earth ions (4fN electronic configurations), and extensions of the point ion model are applied to the transition metal ions with the electronic configurations ndN (n=3, 4, and 5).},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied to selectively analyze the aqueous suspension of Eu2O3(s) particles in the presence of the Eu3+ aquo ion. A plasma was generated by focusing a pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam (λ = 532 nm) into the sample. The light emission from the plasma was detected by a spectrograph equipped with a gated intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) in the wavelength range of 275-525 nm. The atomic emission intensity of the Eu2O3(s) suspension was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the Eu3+ aquo ion. The detection limits for Eu3+(aq) and Eu2O3(s) were found to be 3.3 × 10-5 mol/L and 2.0 × 10-7 mol/L, respectively. Such a difference allows the selective determination of colloidal europium particles. This capability of LIBS was used to study the formation of Eu(OH)3(s) colloids in the aqueous Eu3+ solution by varying pH until the solubility limit was exceeded. The appraisal of the threshold pH for the solubility limit led to the determination of the solubility product of colloidal Eu(OH)3(s), which was then calculated to be log K0sp = -25.5 $\pm$ 0.4.},

abstract = {A novel spectrometer for the rapid and sensitive detection of liquid phase analytes at trace concentrations is presented. Broad bandwidth supercontinuum radiation was coupled into a linear optical cavity incorporating an intracavity liquid-sample cuvette. Cavity enhanced absorption spectra of trace species covering more than 300 nm were acquired on time scales of milliseconds. Single shot acquisition times of 10-50 ms are demonstrated here. The effective absorption path length exceeds 2 m in sample volumes measuring 2.7 mL. A key feature of the instrument is that it can be calibrated using cavity ring-down spectroscopy without the requirement of changing the optical alignment. The sensitivity of the instrument is exemplified by measurements of trace concentrations of dye molecules and nickel sulfate dissolved in water. A minimum detectable absorption coefficient of 9.1 x 10(-7) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) at 550 nm was obtained. The capability to capture broad bandwidth absorption spectra on short time scales permits kinetic studies of liquid phase reactions. We demonstrate this by recording the oscillatory behavior of a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.},

Excitation at wavelengths on the long-wavelength edge of the absorption spectrum of the dye results in redshifted emission, but the quantum yield remains constant at 100%. The origin of this effect and its consequences are discussed. The extent of the long-wavelength tail of the absorption spectrum of the dye is determined and the importance in reabsorption losses is shown. The optical efficiencies and photon transport probabilities of LSCs containing either an organic dye or a rare-earth lanthanide complex are compared using ray-tracing simulations and experiment. The optical efficiency is shown to depend strongly on the Stokes shift of the fluorophore. The lanthanide complex, which has a very large Stokes shift, exhibits a higher optical efficiency than the dye (64% cf. 50%), despite its lower quantum yield (86% cf. 100%).},
