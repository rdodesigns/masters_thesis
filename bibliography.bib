Available experimental absorption and emission data have been analyzed by using Judd--Ofelt analysis. Moreover, semi-empirical calculations have been used to determine the structure of the complex and to interpret the convoluted shape of the absorption spectrum.},

abstract = {The europium absorption spectrum has been photographed at high resolution in the spectral region 7200-2100 A which includes the entire sharp-line spectrum longward of the first ionization limit. Wavelengths and wavenumbers have been determined bycomparison with thorium standards. Since all transitions take place from the ground level the wavenumbers correspond to excitation energies of even-parity levels with total angular momentum (J) of A, 7 or 9. J-values and gj-values have been determined for many of these levels from a study of the longitudinal Zeeman effect in the 5 T (50 kG) field of a superconducting solenoid magnet. The configurations 4f7 (8S) 6s 6p, 4f7 (8S) 6s 7p, 4f7 (8S) 5d 6p and 4f6 (7F) 5d 6s2 are discussed in detail. Levels of 4f6 (7F) 5d2 6s and 4f7 (6I) 6s 6p are reported for the first time. Several long series and parts of series have been discovered among the highly excited levels. Some of these can be identified with levels arising from 4f7 6s (9S) np and 4f7 6s (7S) np but inter- pretation is complicated by the presence of several perturbations of unknown origin.},

About 30 % of the total average output power is located in the 350--600 nm band, which is of primary importance in a number of biophotonics applications such as flow cytometry or fluorescence imaging microscopy for instance. We successfully demonstrate the use of this visible-enhanced source for a three-color imaging of HeLa cells in wide-field microscopy.},

abstract = {A cavity-enhanced absorption setup employing an incoherent broadband light source was used
in combination with a Fourier-transform spectrometer to measure the spin-forbidden B-band of
gaseous oxygen at
∼688 nm and several weak absorption transitions of water vapor in the
same spectral region at room temperature in ambient air. The experiments demonstrate that the
sensitivity of a Fourier-transform spectrometer can be significantly improved by increasing the
effective path length, while retaining a rather small sample volume. In comparison with a single-pass
absorption measurement, we report a path-length enhancement factor of 200 and an improvement
of the signal-to-noise ratio of
≈6 in the present cavity-enhanced absorption experiment. The
practical advantages and limitations of this novel approach are outlined and potential
applications are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Cavity-enhanced methods have been extended to fiber optics by use of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) as reflectors. High-finesse fiber cavities were fabricated from FBGs made in both germanium/boron-co-doped photosensitive fiber and hydrogen-loaded Corning SMF-28 fiber. Optical losses in these cavities were determined from the measured Fabry--Perot transmission spectra and cavity ring-down spectroscopy. For a 10-m-long single-mode fiber cavity, ring-down times in excess of 2 ms were observed at 1563.6 nm, and individual laser pulses were resolved. An evanescent-wave access block was produced within a fiber cavity, and an enhanced sensitivity to optical loss was observed as the external medium's refractive index was altered.},

abstract = {The first demonstration of a cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) based technique, applied to HPLC detection is reported. Broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS) has been used for detection in a HPLC system (HPLC-BBCEAS). Measurements were made on the dyes rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B between 450 and 600 nm. The sensitivity of the measurements as determined by the minimum detectable change in the absorption coefficient, αmin, were 2.9 × 10−5 cm−1 at 527 nm and 1.9 × 10−5 cm−1 at 556 nm, the peak absorption wavelengths of rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) for the two dyes were 426 and 271 pM, respectively. The LOD of the HPLC-BBCEAS setup was found to be between 54 and 77 times lower than with a Perkin-Elmer HPLC (series 200) comprising a 200EP photodiode array detector. The sensitivity of the developed setup also compared favorably with the previous single wavelength HPLC-CRDS studies while using a considerably lower cost experimental se...},

abstract = {A novel method for applying cavity ring-down spectroscopy in the liquid phase, compatible with LC analyses, is presented. The core of the setup is a home-built cavity ring-down flow cell (cell volume 12 μL) that is constructed using a silicon rubber spacer, which is clamped leak-tight between two high-reflectivity mirrors. The mirrors are in direct contact with the liquid flow, which provides for a small path length and short ring-down times. Inside the cavity there are no windows, reflection losses, or Brewster angles to be considered. Due to the small size of the presented cavity geometry, the setup can be implemented in conventional-size LC apparatuses. With a flow injection setup, a detection limit of 2.5 nM was obtained for Crystal Violet in ethanol, and the linear dynamic range of the system is at least 2 orders of magnitude. The method has the potential to become a powerful alternative for commercial LC UV/visible absorbance detectors.},

abstract = {The effects of excitation wavelength on the optical properties (emission spectrum and quantum yield) of a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) containing a fluorescent organic dye (Lumogen F Rot 305) are studied. Excitation at wavelengths on the long-wavelength edge of the absorption spectrum of the dye results in redshifted emission, but the quantum yield remains constant at 100%. The origin of this effect and its consequences are discussed. The extent of the long-wavelength tail of the absorption spectrum of the dye is determined and the importance in reabsorption losses is shown. The optical efficiencies and photon transport probabilities of LSCs containing either an organic dye or a rare-earth lanthanide complex are compared using ray-tracing simulations and experiment. The optical efficiency is shown to depend strongly on the Stokes shift of the fluorophore. The lanthanide complex, which has a very large Stokes shift, exhibits a higher optical efficiency than the dye (64% cf. 50%), despite its lower quantum yield (86% cf. 100%).},

abstract = {New luminometric particle-based methods were developed to quantify protein and to count cells. The developed methods rely on the interaction of the sample with nano- or microparticles and different principles of detection. In fluorescence quenching, timeresolved luminescence resonance energy transfer (TR-LRET), and two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPX) methods, the sample prevents the adsorption of labeled protein to the particles. Depending on the system, the addition of the analyte increases or decreases the luminescence. In the dissociation method, the adsorbed protein protects the Eu(III) chelate on the surface of the particles from dissociation at a low pH. The experimental setups are user-friendly and rapid and do not require hazardous test compounds and elevated temperatures. The sensitivity of the quantification of protein (from 40 to 500 pg bovine serum albumin in a sample) was 20-500-fold better than in most sensitive commercial methods. The quenching method exhibited low protein-to-protein variability and the dissociation method insensitivity to the assay contaminants commonly found in biological samples. Less than ten eukaryotic cells were detected and quantified with all the developed methods under optimized assay conditions. Furthermore, two applications, the method for detection of the aggregation of protein and the cell viability test, were developed by utilizing the TR-LRET method. The detection of the aggregation of protein was allowed at a more than 10,000 times lower concentration, 30 μg/L, compared to the known methods of UV240 absorbance and dynamic light scattering. The TR-LRET method was combined with a nucleic acid assay with cell-impermeable dye to measure the percentage of dead cells in a single tube test with cell counts below 1000 cells/tube.},

abstract = {A novel spectrometer for the rapid and sensitive detection of liquid phase analytes at trace concentrations is presented. Broad bandwidth supercontinuum radiation was coupled into a linear optical cavity incorporating an intracavity liquid-sample cuvette. Cavity enhanced absorption spectra of trace species covering more than 300 nm were acquired on time scales of milliseconds. Single shot acquisition times of 10-50 ms are demonstrated here. The effective absorption path length exceeds 2 m in sample volumes measuring 2.7 mL. A key feature of the instrument is that it can be calibrated using cavity ring-down spectroscopy without the requirement of changing the optical alignment. The sensitivity of the instrument is exemplified by measurements of trace concentrations of dye molecules and nickel sulfate dissolved in water. A minimum detectable absorption coefficient of 9.1 x 10(-7) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) at 550 nm was obtained. The capability to capture broad bandwidth absorption spectra on short time scales permits kinetic studies of liquid phase reactions. We demonstrate this by recording the oscillatory behavior of a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.},
